Hi, githubguyguy here. I literally only added an extra character to the number list

AutoMod Regex Generator is a website that generate and showcases regexes. It can generate regexes that prevent leetspeak such, such as using `ex4mpI3` instead of `example`. The generator is very advanced, being able to prevent substitutions with letters, numbers, symbols, and emojis, even with multiple characters. The site has a second page which shows some useful regexes, such as ones to block links, headers, etc.

If you have any questions fell free to ask in https://discord.gg/4CSc9E5uQy. If you find any bugs, have any feature requests, or regexes you've made, they should go in [Issues](https://github.com/treeben77/automod-regex-generator/issues).
